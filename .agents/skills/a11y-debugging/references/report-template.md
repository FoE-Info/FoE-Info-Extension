# Accessibility audit — <scope>

## Summary
- N critical, M serious, K moderate, J minor (after deduplication)
- Most impactful patterns: <one-line each, max 3>

## Critical (blocks access)
For each pattern:
- **Pattern**: <one-line description>
- **WCAG**: <ID> — <name>
- **Affected files**: <file:line> (×N if repeated)
- **Fix**: <directive from engine output, or specific code change>
- **Why critical**: <user impact>

## Serious
[same shape]

## Moderate / Minor
[Bullet list, deduplicated by rule. Skip per-instance detail unless the fix differs.]

## Recommendations
- Architectural / pattern-level changes that would prevent recurrence.
- Tooling or component abstractions worth introducing.
- What to verify manually (screen reader, keyboard, low-vision testing).

## Positive findings
What the codebase does well — short, factual, reinforces practices to keep.

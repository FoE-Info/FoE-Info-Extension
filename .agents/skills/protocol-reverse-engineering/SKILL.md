# Protocol Reverse Engineering

Comprehensive techniques for capturing, analyzing, and documenting network protocols for security research, interoperability, and debugging.

## Use this skill when

- Working on protocol reverse engineering tasks or workflows
- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for protocol reverse engineering

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to protocol reverse engineering
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `references/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `references/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

## Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
## 5. Record Usage in the Skill Work Log

A skill that only accumulates notes never changes behaviour. Record each real
run and fold the lesson back into this file:

```sh
node .agents/scripts/skill-memory.mjs log \
  --skill <name> \
  --outcome pass|fail|partial \
  --lesson '<imperative rule + why>'
```

`--outcome` is `pass`, `fail`, or `partial`, and every `--signal` is a command
that can actually fail. Patch the workflow above with the lesson in the same
change — the worklog is the audit trail, `SKILL.md` is what the next run reads.
See [Skill Work Log & Memory](references/skill-memory.md) for the full loop.

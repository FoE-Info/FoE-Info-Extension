# Google Antigravity SDK

## Installation & Setup

Before proceeding with any Google Antigravity tasks, ensure the environment is
ready:

- **Verify Applicability**: If operating in an existing codebase, verify that
  using this Python SDK is possible and appropriate for the project.
- **Check Dependencies**: Check if `google-antigravity` is listed in the
  project's dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`).
- **Install Package**: Ensure the `google-antigravity` Python package is
  installed.
- **Authentication Setup**: Check for a valid `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment
  variable or a `.env` file (required to access Gemini models).
  - If credentials are missing, you MUST actively help the user get set up
    with an API key by providing the following link:
    - Default to Google AI Studio:
      `https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys`
  - Explain that the API key can be passed explicitly in code as shorthand
    (e.g., `LocalAgentConfig(api_key="...")`) or automatically read from the
    environment.
  - For Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform (formerly Vertex AI)
    authentication, the SDK uses Application Default Credentials (ADC).
    Instruct the user to run `gcloud auth application-default login` and
    configure the agent with `vertex=True` along with `project` and
    `location` in `LocalAgentConfig`.
  - **Note**: For local models (`LiteRTAgentConfig` or
    `LocalOpenAIAgentConfig`), no API key or cloud credentials are needed.
    See `references/local_models.md` for setup details.

## Routing Table

Use the following information to dig deeper into specific topics based on the
user request. Read the referenced files or explore the directories to find
relevant information.

### References

- If the user needs to understand the high-level overview and core concepts of
  the Google Antigravity SDK (Agent, Conversation, Connection), read
  `references/architecture.md`.
- If the user needs to perform advanced agent configuration, select
  appropriate models, configure connection reliability (e.g., if experiencing
  latency or reliability issues), or understand the critical rules for model
  identifiers to avoid assumptions, read `references/agent_configuration.md`.
- If the user needs to extend an agent's capabilities by integrating Model
  Context Protocol (MCP) servers, or configure tool permissions for the agent,
  read `references/mcp_integration.md`.
- If the user needs to define safety policies, resolve execution order, or
  restrict agent actions using predicates, read
  `references/safety_policies.md`.
- If the user needs to debug failed agents, stream logs, or implement error
  recovery using hooks to make agents robust, read
  `references/error_handling.md`.
- If the user needs to monitor costs, track token usage (including thinking
  tokens), or build custom audit logs for advanced monitoring, read
  `references/observability.md`.
- If the user needs to see a list of built-in tools and understand their default state, read `references/built_in_tools.md`.
- If the user needs to run agents locally using on-device models (e.g., Gemma
  via LiteRT, or via OpenAI-compatible APIs), understand hardware
  requirements, or set up a local model environment, read
  `references/local_models.md`.

### Examples

- If the user needs to implement basic agent behavior, streaming responses, or
  expose internal thoughts, read `examples/getting_started/hello_world.md`.
- If the user needs to customize or override default retry behavior and
  exponential backoff for API errors or schema validation, read
  `examples/getting_started/customizing_retries.md`.
- If the user needs to equip an agent with custom capabilities (tools) derived
  from Python functions, or maintain agent state across tool execution, read
  `examples/getting_started/custom_tool.md`.
- If the user needs to shape an agent's persona, define its system
  instructions, or dynamically adapt its behavior, read
  `examples/getting_started/persona_config.md`.
- If the user needs to build multimodal agents capable of processing images
  and PDFs, or generating visual content, read
  `examples/getting_started/multimodal.md`.
- If the user needs to implement multi-agent delegation, allowing a main agent
  to spawn and orchestrate subagents for complex tasks, read
  `examples/getting_started/subagents.md`.
- If the user needs to connect an agent to external services via MCP (Stdio or
  SSE), read `examples/getting_started/mcp_tools.md`.
- If the user needs to create proactive agents that respond to time-based
  events or file system triggers in the background, read
  `examples/getting_started/periodic_trigger.md`.
- If the user needs to intercept agent lifecycle events (e.g., pre/post turn,
  tool execution, errors) to customize execution flow, read
  `examples/getting_started/hooks.md`.
- If the user needs to implement turn-level cancellation or programmatic
  stream aborts, read `examples/getting_started/cancellation.md`.
- If the user needs to implement persistent agents that remember past
  interactions across sessions, read
  `examples/getting_started/persistence.md`.
- If the user needs to override the default application data directory
  for agent artifacts, scratch files, and media storage, read
  `examples/getting_started/app_data_dir_override.md`.
- If the user needs an agent to output structured data (e.g., JSON matching a
  Pydantic schema) for reliable integration, read
  `examples/getting_started/structured_output.md`.
- If the user needs to add, configure, or load agent skills into the Google
  Antigravity SDK agent, read `examples/getting_started/agent_skills.md`.
- If the user needs to enable and use built-in web tools (like Google Search
  or URL fetching) with the agent, read
  `examples/getting_started/web_tools.md`. (Note: when fetching massive web
  pages or articles, pair `read_url_content` with `view_file` to inspect
  cached disk files).
- If the user needs to set up and run a local model agent (LiteRT with Gemma,
  or an OpenAI-compatible server like Ollama), including model download,
  hardware requirements, and context window configuration, read
  `examples/getting_started/local_models.md`.
